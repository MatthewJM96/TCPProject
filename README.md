# Theory Computing Project
This is the Theory Computing Project undertaken by Matthew Marshall and Michael James for their second year theoretical physics course at the University of Manchester.

## Aims:
The project's aims are to:
* Investigate the scarring effect in a quantum billiards simulation.
* Investigate the effects of choosing different topologies for the 2D infinite well for the simulation.
* Investigate approximation techniques to improve efficiency of such simulations.
